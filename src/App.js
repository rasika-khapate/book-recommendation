                    Book by Christopher Voss and Tahl Raz,as this excellent and
                    fascinating book reveals, there can be empathy,
                    understanding, taking care of people, and even joy in
                    negotiations. This book is ultimately more about emotional
                    intelligence and effective listening than it is about
                    anything else.
